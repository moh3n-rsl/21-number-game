# 21_number_game

<span style="font-weight: 400;">Alternatively known as Game 21, Twenty plus One, and Bagram, it’s a game generally played between two players (though you can include more) which advances by checking up 1 to 21, with the player who calls "21" is disposed of.</span>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Consider two players A and B. They are given a bucket list of numbers 1,2 and 3 to play the game. Whatever number the first player, say A chooses from the given list, player B’s choice of number gets added to it. In the next round, A’s chosen number gets added to the previous addendum with B. The game proceeds in the same manner until the addendum with any player becomes 21, and that player is said to have lost the game.</span></p>

<h2 id="id10"><strong>What are the Rules and Constraints to be kept in mind?</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">A player can decide whether he wishes to take the initial plunge. Before proceeding with game 21, the list of numbers a player can choose from is displayed on the screen.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">On the off chance that consecutive numbers are not given in input, that player loses and can't proceed with the game.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Neither of the players can exceed or pass the total count of 21. For example, if the addendum with a player at a particular stage is 19, he cannot choose 3 as it will make the total count reach 22, which isn’t allowed. Hence, that player can choose either 1 or 2 to continue playing the game.</span></li>
<li style="font-weight: 400;" aria-level="1"><span style="font-weight: 400;">The game ends whenever a player calls 21, making the other player win henceforth.</span></li>
</ul>
